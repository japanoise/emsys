.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple TUI text editor that uses the well-known Emacs
keybindings. While
.Nm
does not support extension through Lisp programming, those that use
Emacs and are unsatisfied with running or unable to run Emacs in the
terminal will find
.Nm
a comfortable editing experience.
.Sh USAGE
For the most part,
.Nm
uses the same keybindings as other flavors of Emacs or ersatz-emacs.
The file README.md describes each keybinding in detail.  You should
have received a copy of this file with the program; if not, you can
find it at the upstream repository (see the
.Sx BUGS
section). If you used the makefile to install
.Nm
then this file should also be at $(PREFIX)/share/doc/emsys.md (PREFIX
is /usr/local by default)
